There's a lot to say about how designers should work together in interdisciplinary teams. Some designers are open to sharing their work early, while others are not. The dread sense and urge to jump in front of the relentless train of judgement to defend your work, to protect oneself, dominates the weekly meeting. What if your solution isn't sufficiently inventive? 

<br>

What exactly is creativity?


<br>

## Bird by bird


<br>

According to Merriam-Webster dictionary, the definition of creativity is: 

1 : the ability to create

2 : the quality of being creative
<br>

As designers, we use frameworks to help us work together as a team. A framework is a general term that refers to a necessary supporting structure on which other things are built.

<br>


A design is either a plan or specification for the building of an object or system, or the output of that plan or specification in the form of a prototype, product, or process.



<br>


Which of the many design frameworks available, such as double diamond, design thinking, hook model, and lean ux -  is the best?


<br>


The answer is that it is debatable. It depends on the stage of your project, the difficulties that need to be solved, the timeframe, and the team resources you have available to assist in various areas.


<br>

The same is valid for visual inspiration: where do you look for visual inspiration? Are all visual sources relevant to your problem's topic? How can you be innovative enough to 'wow' your team with a solution in weekly meetings?




<br>


## Creatividade, creativity, クリエイティビティ, Kreativität


<br>

While frameworks are similar to recipes, in which they give the cook a set of directions, including a list of items to use in order to achieve a specific result, creativity is the opposite. The only requirement for creativity as a digital product designer is to solve problems.

<br>

Creativity is a sign system with no set referents due to the diversity of approaches to solving problems through design and inspiration sources.
