<br>
Stop comparing yourself to other people. It is unjust, toxic, and ineffective.
<br>

<br>
Not everyone is dealt the same hand of cards. When you compare your career, life, or skills to those of your colleagues, you are voluntarily dismissing all of your hard work and accomplishments. Some skills are easier to learn than others; don't let difficulty discourage you from persevering.


<br>
<br>
You want to try a new design software but it appears intimidating, and your coworker appears to be very comfortable? Regardless, give it a shot. Ask for assistance, be inquisitive, and conduct research. Do you want to call it quits after 10 minutes of exploring? Do it, but come back to it later. It will gradually become easier, and your evolution will be well on its way.

<br>
Don't be satisfied with processes and outcomes. Can those processes be improved in any way to accelerate your development as a designer? Explore, try it out, tinker around, and be curious and playful. These are the qualities that allow you to break the mold and bring something genuine and new to every team you're a part of.

<br>
<br>
Maintaining a comparing mindset will allow toxicity to control all aspects of your professional and personal life. You'll be held hostage, and that toxicity will be violent and ruthless to others at any given opportunity, leaving you to watch and feel helpless.

<br>

If those thoughts begin to creep in, be mindful of them and recognize them for what they are: mere thoughts. You're in command, so you do the opposite of what your toxic thoughts want.

<br>
Comparison of different situations is ineffective. Create a plan tailored to your specific situation if you want to accelerate your professional and personal development. Read more, write more, sketch more, watch more movies, spend more time with your family, try new things that you don't normally try, and get out of your comfort zone.
