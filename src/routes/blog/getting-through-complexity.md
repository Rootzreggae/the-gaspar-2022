People frequently commend me on my time management and organisational skills. I'm not extraordinary - I've simply embraced productivity strategies that work for me.
<br>



## What's the secret?

There’s no secret - lists, pomodoro technique and timeboxing, that’s it (don’t go just yet, please continue reading).
<br>


## A necessary change


It used to be a huge struggle for me to balance my work and personal commitments, which led to a near-burnout from Design. 
We all have the same 24 hours in a day, but excellent designer leaders manage to get a lot done in that time. How do they do it? I'd like to be able to do the same thing.

<br>

I was working at a startup at the time and didn't have a designated Design manager. I reported directly to the CEO and CTO, however my weekly report merely consisted of a weekly meeting, where I would go through the work I had completed, and receive a new batch of tasks for the coming week. However, more activities and objectives would appear during the week, piling up.



<br>


Some weeks I'd finish the tasks, and other weeks I'd have to shift the workload to the following week, which was fine for a while.


<br>


Soon after I realized that I was 'skipping' or 'forgetting' random duties, generally the most monotonous. Which was perplexing in and of itself, because I would perform them frequently, and as the workload grew, the problem grew as well.

<br>



I needed to figure out how to be productive without jeopardizing my mental health and my personal life.


<br>


The Laws of Simplicity by John Maeda was one of the books I read. It was an excellent introduction to breaking down complicated problems/tasks into smaller, more manageable parts. It piqued my interest in seeing how other design leaders might handle a similar scenario.

## What is timeboxing?

Timeboxing is a project planning technique. The schedule is broken down into several time periods (timeboxes), each with its own set of deliverables, deadlines, and budget.


<br>

## What is pomodoro technique?




Francesco Cirillo developed the Pomodoro Technique in the late 1980s as a time management technique. It employs a timer to divide work into intervals of 25 minutes, with short rests in between. After the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student, each interval is called a pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato.

## Drawing in a straight line

<br>


I got into the habit of making lists. In my professional life, I make a list of all the problems I need to solve and then split them down into smaller pieces or subjects.

I pick five as my daily limit and allot a certain amount of time from my day to complete them. If they aren't finished in the time allotted, I move on and come back to them the next day.

This approach allowed me to make time for unscheduled meetings, read to satisfy my curiosity, slow down, and still fulfill deadlines. My calendar always has (nearly) time slots open for unplanned assistance for my team.
