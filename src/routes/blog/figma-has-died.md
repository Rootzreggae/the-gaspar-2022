<br>
Because of Adobe's track record of destroying apps, I initially felt betrayed. After some reading, Figma CEO announcements, and designer opinions on Twitter, I realized that the operation has no bearing on me or my work.
<br>
Yes, I like Figma; it's one of the tools I use, but in the worst-case scenario, if Figma fails, there are many other tools I can use to replace it.
<br>
As an example, consider Adobe Illustrator. I used to love Illustrator, and I used it for everything, including UX/UI (back when Photoshop was the go-to tool for these tasks) - it just felt right to me to have sharp vectors in an artboard, and it really unlocked my speed and creativity.
<br>
But when Adobe got greedy and started charging monthly fees, I ditched Illustrator and installed a trial version of Affinity Designer, after which I purchased the license. A one-time purchase with interesting customization and illustration options, it is still my primary illustration tool.
<br>
Before Figma, I used Sketch, but abandoned it in 2016 when the 6-month license policy was implemented. I tried Adobe XD, which had interesting options but ultimately felt like it hampered collaboration between me and engineering.
<br>
I tried Figma and continue to use it. All of this is to remind you, the wonderful reader, that there is no need to pledge allegiance to a single tool, and just as Figma rose to its current position, there are other tools that will rise and allow us to continue pushing digital product design to new heights if Figma dies to Adobe.
