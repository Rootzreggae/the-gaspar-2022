Unless they have a good understanding of how an automobile engine operates at a fundamental level, Designers shouldn't be allowed to drive.

<br>

## per·son  (ˈpər-sᵊn)

<br>

My first car was an Opel Astra from 1993. She (yes) had already been in use for 19 years when I got her. Many things didn't work after two previous owners, including the air conditioning, a few lights, and various engine parts that needed to be replaced. But it was functional, and because it was my first car, I adored her despite her state.


<br>

Because of the mileage, the engine leaked oil, and I had to top off the oil tank on a monthly basis to keep it level. Buying an oil jug every two months and keeping it in the trunk became second nature. Despite not having an expert level of grasp of how an automotive engine functions at the time (or today), I did it for three years straight.

<br>

To maintain the car operating smoothly, I didn't need to know much about engines to realize that I needed to draw the oil measurement dipstick from time to time to check the oil level.

<br>

## hu·man (ˈhyü-mən)

<br>

In the early 2000s, I was a teenager. Broadband internet was becoming more widely available, and online multiplayer games were all the rage: Unreal Tournament 99, Medal of Honor, Street Fighter Third Strike, Cossacks, warcraft 3 - I was already a fan of gaming culture, but now I could share it with people from all over Europe.

<br>

The popularity of web forum platforms was skyrocketing. Conceptart.org, Pendako, Eatpoo, and Deviantart, to mention a few, were among the sites I visited on a daily basis since they were centered on art, primarily digital illustration.

<br>

With the help of a handful of friends I met on DeviantArt, I eventually started my own art forum. We'd share daily doodles and talk about techniques. I was the platform's admin, and as such, I would make any html changes/upgrades that the platform required. I had prior expertise with actionscript 2 in Flash and building my own Mugen engine fighting game.

<br>

Fast forward a few years, and I'm a design student at ULHT in Lisbon, where we had an html and CSS course. I was overjoyed since I had a 'head start' and was able to explore even more.

<br>

## soul (ˈsōl)

<br>

Should designers learn how to code?

Yes. You don't need to be an expert in html, css, javascript, or any other framework. When working with engineers and PMs, knowing the basics on how to code makes you (us) stronger and more assertive designers.

<br>

If you believe designer’s shouldn’t code, then by that logic designers shouldn’t be allowed to drive. If you're going to produce digital products for the future, I believe you should at least have a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.

<br>

Feed your curiosity by trying to see new things through the eyes of a child.
